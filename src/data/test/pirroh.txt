@pbailis apart from YARN (as you already said), I guess the issue is on the fault-tolerance model--clear for MR, big ? for all the others.

My take on Google's Knowledge Graph, Freebase and Wolfram|Alpha: http://t.co/IVF4JTg4 -- hopefully a new dawn in semantic search!
@JonMwords I knew the WolframAlpha vs KnowledgeGraph was coming! Just sent a reply comment in your article.
@JonMwords you'll have to explain people the difference between WolframAlpha and G+KnowledgeGraph. Quite the treat!
@JonMwords great article, and I hope this is just an appetizer. Can't wait to read more.
@nddrylliog yep, me too. I don't care who's the cool kid in social--I just hope G+ is here to stay if it improves Search substantially!
@JonMwords Cleary Freebase played a key role in bootstrapping their graph, but the two orders of magnitude must come from somewhere else.
The success of G+ can be argued, but a knowledge graph with people as first-class citizens is an extremely interesting by-product.
How come the Google Knowledge Graph has ~500mil objects vs the handful mils of Wikipedia/DBpedia? efforts in "social" are the answer.
RT @Seshness: "You should do more than follow your passion; you should direct it." - Michael Olson, CS commencement speaker
@nddrylliog true that, but you're not saying "frugal is the only way to go". You just begged them to ACK the existence of different ways.
@nddrylliog while there, I'd also replace the course-specific introduction with something like: the "Swiss" approach vs. @thebootstrap_ch
@nddrylliog I would keep "the less good" and "entrepreneurship and boundaries", with some editing here and there to make it generic.
